The desktop interface has remained fundamentally unchanged for over two decades, relying on legacy paradigms that haven't scaled to meet new modern needs.  
  
Industry leaders like Apple and Microsoft are too deeply entrenched in their established ecosystems to risk radical shifts. While the Linux community has shown some appetite for experimentation, much of it has nibbled at the edges such as focusing on tweaking window management.  
  
This talk reflects my lifetime experience as a UX designer at Apple and Google and how the deepest innovations happen at the most mundane level: richer input, better data flows, and breaking out of our 2d windowing prisons. Ironically, the open source nature of Linux and specifically KDE provides a unique opportunity to break free from these legacy constraints.

### The desktop stagnation

**0:09** · Thank you. I'm really, really glad to be here.

**0:12** · Um I um have been in UX design for a very long time. I've worked at Symbian for a while, at Google, and at Apple.

**0:20** · And um it was really fascinating about me being at Google all those years is I I really noticed a kind of a cultural shift because back in 2005 when I joined, we weren't evil, right? Uh we we were really trying to do the right thing. And I worked on the Chrome team for a while, and the Chrome team was filled with nothing but people that wanted nothing but open source, open web type projects. And things then just really changed radically. And so I left a few years ago.

**0:50** · And I've been trying to I've I've made this joke a few times now, but I I I'm trying to atone for my sins for by working for these companies. Um I now mentor uh UX designers. I do UX design for Mastodon and for Home Assistant. So I do work on open source projects.

**1:07** · Um and I've just been trying to work in this space doing UX design, just trying to kind of squeeze a little bit more you a good UX design into open source.

**1:17** · Um I don't want to be too confrontational, but I just I do think that uh open source needs a lot of UX design help.

**1:25** · And it's a challenging thing to do because most people are understaffed, things are really, really busy. There's a good reasons for it. It's not just that you're a bunch of programmers. That's way too simplistic a way of talking about it. Um I'm here because I gave a talk similar to this at Ubuntu last year.

**1:45** · And um some It was a small conference, a little bit like this. Um I was in a more of an esoteric topic. I was excited to talk about it, but I didn't expect much from it. And it went on YouTube and it went nuts. Um, it's got over half a million views, which by YouTube standards is trivial.

**2:06** · Uh, but by Scott standards, it's enormous. I've I've I've never had a talk go that viral before. It was really shocking. So, I think I hit a nerve. I think there's something here that people want to talk about. And so, uh, the issue for me though is I want to talk a little bit about desktop UX specifically because I think it's very different from other other types of UX.

### The problem with desktop UX

**2:26** · So, back when I I worked at Apple on the finder team, uh, the team wanted to do ellipses. And so, the idea, this isn't going to work really well. They wanted to put the ellipses at the end, and I was just like, "No, no, no, you're losing way too much interesting information. You should put the ellipses in the middle." And so, they didn't have a string routine to do that, so they added it. Uh, they were very easy to work with, and it's now considered one of those things that's an exciting little attention-to-detail issue that the Macintosh does.

**2:52** · And so, um, it's frankly very fun to see that something you had a part of 40 years ago is still shipping.

**3:00** · Um, uh, another small one is this idea that you can drag a icon from one window that's in the background to the foreground.

**3:09** · Cuz on most Linux systems, when you click on mouse down, the window comes forward.

**3:14** · And on the Macintosh, selection happens on mouse down, but the window coming forward happens on mouse up. So, it allows you to drag things from a window behind. And this is not just some trivial little thing about copying icons. Cuz if you talk to a Linux person, they're like, "I just use a command line. What's your problem?"

**3:31** · And I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no. It's more than just copying files. It's about dragging things into applications." And this is a fundamentally user data movement thing. Without the ability to do this, you can't move data into applications quite as easily. And so, I talked about this 2 years ago actually on on and I I talked about this is not an edge case, and then someone from KDE responded and said, "Oh, that's a good idea. I just implemented it."

**3:59** · And I and I and I forgot who that was.

**4:01** · So, if anybody is here that did that, thank you.

**4:06** · I've been wanting to meet you for 2 years.

**4:10** · \[applause\] And it's it's an example of how open source can be awesome cuz someone said, "That's a good idea. I'll just do it." So, my big point though is that the desktop has not changed in 20 years.

**4:24** · There's a lot of things happening in the '80s and the '90s, and then it just stabilized, and not much has really changed. And we there's so much more that we're doing today with our computers than when we did 20 years ago.

**4:36** · I think there's ways for it to grow. And so, a lot of our the UX that happens in these systems was initially copied from Windows and Mac. KDE even says it's for Windows users. It wants to be similar to Windows users. So, there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's it's a compliment because originally the Xerox Star came out, and it implemented it influenced the Macintosh, and then the Mac I wouldn't say it influenced Windows cuz Windows really did a terrible job.

**5:03** · Um and then of course along came all the different Linux distros. And then of course over time once things matured, it flowed back again. So, I would say the initial model was there, and then it kind of went back and forth a little bit. Um so, what's the problem? Well, the problem is that the Linux community in general has been just leaning on Apple and Microsoft to do all of the research, the testing, and frankly the mistakes. Like who who wants to like implement Clippy again, right?

**5:31** · I mean, it's it's good that they do these things first cuz then we can kind of draft behind them. It's actually a very smart thing to do. But the problem is they're not doing anything anymore.

**5:43** · They're just kind of given up to a certain extent. And so, I like this quote from Alan Kay who says perspective is worth 80 IQ points. It's the same problem, you're the same person, but the ability to see the problem in a new way, I think, allows you to see a problem and find out different solutions. So, that's what the today's talk is. I This is a smaller version. You Some of you have seen my talk before will recognize some of these slides, but I've tried to limit that a little bit. But, I do want to talk about the perspective side of things.

**6:11** · And the biggest critique I got of the Ubuntu talk was that I did not give any specific examples. And so, I'm going to try to fix that. So, half of this talk will be prototypes of these ideas I'm going to show you guys. So, Apple, I think, really made their play in 2017.

### Corporate failure in innovation

**6:28** · Um I think it's pretty easy to see in retrospect that the back in 2017, Apple hated the Macintosh. They I mean, everything they did with the stupid keyboard to getting rid of all the ports on the the MacBook Pro uh to just letting the cheese grater Mac Pro like languish for years and years and years.

**6:47** · Um and then what really cemented that idea was this ad they did in 2017 where they showed this very cute young student going through doing cool things with her iPad. And just And at the end of the day, she's sitting in the backyard typing away. And the neighbor leans over the fence and goes, "Oh, what you doing with your computer?" And she turns and just innocent, kind little thing says, "What's a computer?"

**7:12** · Just as like, "You old person." You know, I mean, like Apple wanted the Mac to die. They wanted the world to move over to the iPad. And guess what? It didn't. And now they're kind of like going, "Whoops." Cuz it's now their problem. And now they're doing all sorts of crazy things to kind of like, "Oh, I guess the Mac's important now." and trying to do that. Um it's caused a lot of issues there. They also The things they've done with the Macintosh have been kind of dumb, right? I mean, like liquid glass has not been really popular. And the latest version of Mac actually took away a lot of what LiquidGlass did.

**7:44** · So, they're not really And then the the features they do add tend to be about tying it closer to the iPhone. They're basically in tying you into their ecosystem, which is not a bad idea, but it's really building their moat higher. It's not really improving the desktop.

**8:03** · And Microsoft is just making one mistake after another. I mean, they're just they've had the thirsty OneDrive sign-ups, the Recall end of life disaster, um ads everywhere. You know, it's just really it just I mean, you guys know this. Um my short story was I interviewed there 8 years ago to uh be uh head of UX for Windows.

**8:26** · And it's really not cool to kiss and tell and talk about that, but what I will say is that when you go there, you go in with an agenda. You don't get a job like that kind of going, "Well, whatever you want." No, you go in and say, "This is what I'll do." And I was talking about this issue back then, that the desktop needed to evolve.

**8:46** · It's not like I wanted to blow up Windows. I understand that there's hundreds of millions of users, and you just can't change things. It'll freak people out. I mean, I'm I'm not a monster, right? I mean, I don't want to like change everything. I want it to be kind of, you know, but I wanted there to be experiments. I wanted to be some additional things that were going on.

**9:04** · And they didn't want that, and it was really clear that it was not a good match. So, I'm I'm really glad that didn't work out. So, my point is is that the whole Linux community has been just waiting for Apple and Microsoft more or less to take all the risks. And they're not taking any more risks.

**9:26** · So, what are we going to do about it?

**9:28** · And we just can't patch and bug fix our way into the future. We actually have to like start taking leadership ourselves. And what does that mean? What does that look like? Now, whenever I say that the desktop has stopped, I kind of get three pushbacks. The first one is this kind of somewhat shallow, "Okay, boomer. Mobile won. Desktop, you know, is old. It just just do what mobile does." I'm like, "Oh, my sweet young child. No. No, no, no. Of course mobile won. I'm not going to argue that mobile is small or insignificant. It's huge, right?

**9:59** · But it won consumers. It won gaming. It won social media. It won cameras. Okay? It didn't win productivity. You don't see companies with everybody sitting at their desk with their phones typing away, right?

**10:13** · That's They Desktops are silently \[snorts\] awesome. They have keyboards and big screens and they can do amazing things and we don't We've almost gotten bored by it. We're kind of like almost embarrassed. Oh, well, yeah, they're awesome, but they've been awesome for a while. Whatever. We don't really appreciate kind of how good they are.

**10:32** · And so, I think that we should kind of appre- uh understand why they're so good and then what we can do to make them better. The second pushback I get is, uh it's a standard. It's like you can only do Windows so many ways. Just stop trying to kind of fix it. It's done. And I'm like, "No." I mean, like CD-ROMs were a standard. BlackBerry, for those of you old enough, um was a standard and they have all gone by the wayside.

**10:59** · I'd even go so far as to say that the, you know, the laptop is kind of an ergonomic standard. We just assume that everything has to be in a screen this big with a pointer and a And it's like, "No, I think there's other kinds of hardware that's coming along, too, that can be interesting."

**11:14** · And the third pu- pushback I get a lot, uh I think this comes really strongly in the the the tech community, is, "Don't touch my stuff. I've worked really hard to get this desktop exactly the way I want it and if you change it, I'm going to be pissed."

**11:27** · And I'm I get that. Um and I as I said before, you don't want to change everything, but I also think that the world is moving and things are happening. We need new tools and we need to grow our way gently into some new things. So, I think we're in this perfect situation where the desktop UX has stopped improving and when I talk about it, so many people kind of go, "Yeah, whatever. I don't I don't want to Why Why do you want to do that?" And I'm trying to say, "No, we need to do something about this."

**11:58** · So, that's the the problem. Now, let's go into the perspective side of things.

### Redefining user experience

**12:02** · How can we think about this to figure out where we want to go next? So, like I said before, I don't want to create something crazy. I think I want to have an incrementally small change of things, right? So, but it gets into this question though is what is UX? And I think the \[snorts\] term UX, especially in the tech community, is massively misunderstood. I hate the term UI/UX with the heat of a thousand suns. It is the stupidest term that has ever been invented and it was in done The UX community did it to ourselves.

**12:34** · We're the only ones to blame for this. Because back a long time ago when I started off at Apple, we called it human interface. And then as things got more involved, they called it user interface.

**12:49** · And then Don Norman came along and he actually called the term user experience and it was the same thing. We were just evolving the terms. We just kind of called it a little bit more, but it's the same stuff. Okay? And then along came Figma and just everything up.

**13:03** · And And it really pissed me off because what happened was we got a whole bunch of visual designers and visual designers are a subset of design and they Yes, I'm going to go there. I'm going to go there because the visual designers did this.

**13:17** · They basically said, "Oh, we're not getting enough attention. So, we're going to take the term that you used to use and we're going to use it and mean something else." And just confused the hell out of everybody, so now it's this UI UX term and UX is composed of 12 \[snorts\] different disciplines and now we say, "Oh, but there's just two."

**13:36** · Everything else and UI and nobody knows what it means. And when you ask most people, especially like more manager types, they just think it's pixels. And it's like no, UX is so much more than pixels and that's what's hard to talk about. And so if you really want to piss off a UX designer, this works really well. This works really well.

**14:00** · \[laughter\] Yeah, this this this causes fights.

**14:04** · Um and it's helpful to think of UX as having layers and there's many ways that you can cut it, many groups have talked about it, but there's three basic ones.

**14:13** · You start with style and style is white space, iconography, colors, yeah, pixels, right? But then there's the structure, you know, how do you move through the application? What's your navigational model? What's your error How do you handle errors? How do you get How do you start? There's all the flow through all the pixels is the structure.

**14:33** · And then more important one, I think is strategy. Who is their user? What do they want? What is important? What's not important? What are you going to ignore?

**14:41** · The fastest way a UX designer can save your team time is to help you say no. And it's hard, especially with open source, to say no to anybody. I understand that. But if you want to prioritize things, it helps to have the strategy layer. So I wrote I wrote a book many years ago called The Simplicity Shift and I actually said there's a layer below this, which I kind of called stuff.

**15:05** · Because cuz I just liked ST words and then I, you know, um and it's really more like underlying technology. Like if if you're, you know, if you're writing a DOS application, you're not going to write a nice, you know, Macintosh application. The technology dictates what you can do. But more importantly, what I'm talking about is now that we've had 40 years of evolution, that we have an awful lot of expected standards. There's how things work that we just assume is going to stick around.

**15:33** · And it's just historical cruft, if I can use that American term. But, the idea is that we just have a bunch of stuff that we've just accepted.

**15:42** · And I think if we're going to fix the desktop, we have to understand this lower-level limitation, and how do we want to fix that?

**15:50** · We just accept that mobile and desktop has stuff today, and we just don't think about you know, fixing it. So, let me give you an example of this. Um, mobile text editing, I did some work on on the Android team about fixing text editing.

**16:02** · And so, we did a study where we asked people to get rid of this There's two spaces here. And we just said, "Just remove that space." And you'd think we were asking them to do brain surgery. We We asked 10 people to do it, and they all could not do it. What ended up happening was I just I just said There's effectively this particular This is a video of a real user. This is actually I didn't do this. This is a user. And there was five attempts. They They tapped to the right. They tapped to the left. They accidentally would drag the cursor. They accidentally brought up the menu, and then they finally got it.

**16:35** · And we found out how bad it was because when people started when we started asking people about editing, "Oh, well, I don't do that." What do you do? Well, I I start on the mobile, then I finish it on the desktop.

**16:45** · I mean, really? I said, "What happens if you have Well, then I'll I'll just select the whole thing and delete it and start over." I mean, editing is so bad, they just decided not to do it. I was really surprised by that. So, what we ended up doing was Well, the reason why it was a problem is that it's basically a bad copy of desktop. So much of UX is copying other things and not really being sure as to how it's working. And so, the big problem with desktop is that there's no mouse cursor, there's no menu bar, there's no command keys. All you've got is a finger and a tap. And everything has to go through this one action.

**17:16** · And so you're effectively you're multiplexing tap. So tap has to insert, it has to drag, it has to bring up a menu, it has to do all this stuff, and it's just too much, and it just makes things difficult. So, what we did on the Android team is we Well, it This never shipped. It's one of the reasons why Oh, this is one of the reasons why I left because they they It's \[clears throat\] a long story. You get I mean, it It Buy me a beer and we'll talk about it.

**17:43** · Um but the idea was that uh we had we basically invented a new long press event that allowed you to select this, and it worked really really really well. Now, the desktop has the same thing. Um people forget that the original Macintosh was a whopping 342 pixels high. That's smaller than most icons today, right? Um and that was the screen size.

### The role of AI and context

**18:08** · And so guess what? Things overlapped a lot. And we just assumed that windows have to overlap. And now that we have giant giant giant screens, anybody who's tried using a window manager on a large screen, you just get tired, right? And it's I can understand why people use tiled window systems and so forth because this existing model just does not work very well. So, there's all sorts of just historical things that we've just accepted.

**18:33** · So, Alan Kay, who as you can tell I really like a lot, has talked a lot about thinking about the future. Now, he's never said these things in this particular order, but he's written about them, so I'm stealing it. He talks about the three steps to understand stuff. What is your present?

**18:48** · What is going on right now?

**18:51** · Don't forget your past. Know what work has been done before. Stand on the shoulders of giants. And then finally is really make sure your questions are clear. Too many people rush to solutions. You should really be rushing to questions. And if you can be clear on the questions, the answers come better.

**19:09** · So, let me take these in order. What is your present?

**19:12** · What is happening right now on the desktop?

**19:15** · I'll give you three guesses. I did not want to make this talk about AI and I have to talk about AI and it pisses me off because there's so many cool things we could be talking about and AI just sucks up all the oxygen and it's all you can talk about.

**19:33** · Almost every conversation I have back home always ends up talking about AI and it just it's getting old. Um so the but the fascinating thing is so many things are happening with AI on the desktop and they're all doing it in a really weird way. So Google has this thing called AI pointer. It's a research thing where you can talk while you point at things and they have the the Google book shake your cursor and they're fine.

**19:56** · I don't want to say they're bad or anything but what they're trying to do is keep the entire desktop use exactly the same and they're trying to sneak AI in. And that's kind of one approach to do it. The other one is this lovely project which I knew that would go over really well.

**20:15** · \[laughter\] And um and the problem I think with here is that people keep saying this is an AI OS and that is so irritating. It's not an AI OS. It's basically Apple script with a chatbot.

**20:29** · Okay.

**20:32** · I mean really I mean yes I actually think that if it wasn't by DHS this we could have a conversation about how this is interesting and by scripting and automating scripting at the lower levels yes there could be some interesting things here.

**20:46** · But it's just scripting the lower level system access. It's not a complete re- rework of the entire system. So what are all these things Oh and by the way um there's so much more that's coming in this space. Apple has this thing called on-screen awareness which is trying to understand what's happening on your screen. Android has the exact same thing called assist structure. Even free desktop.org by the way, is getting involved in this.

**21:09** · But they're all effectively trying to understand what's happening on the screen so that you can talk to it with a chatbot or you know, a voice prompt, which is again, I think kind of missing the opportunity here. So what's happening, I think, is that we have this kind of matrix, this continuum here, where we have the Google things with a cursor coming in at the top and all these other operating system type things coming at the bottom. So we have thing we have AI coming in above the UX or below the UX, but there's nothing really in the middle, which I thought was really fascinating.

**21:40** · So this is where I was starting to kind of go, wait, something weird is happening here. So what I I what I the the glimmer that I had that could be this something actually is interesting happening was this. People AI is moving so quickly that people forget that last summer AI was running out of steam. People were just doing they're getting frustrated with all the hallucination. People weren't really getting a lot of value out of it.

### Future-proofing via working memory

**22:04** · And then along came Claude Code and they're like, oh, this actually kind of can work. And it completely changed things because what it was doing was it was looking down into your file system. Instead of you providing context, it was getting context from your file system and that allowed it to do something more interesting.

**22:21** · And now whether you're doing with files whether you're doing it with coding or with Obsidian with personal a lot of experimentations are going on here. Now again, I'm not I should probably say by the way that I have a lot of personal problems with the the um frontier models. Uh they are ethical and environmental disasters. I am not very excited by them. I think there's lots of issues with them.

**22:44** · Um but I'm only calling it out because everyone's talking about it right now. I am kind of excited by the fact that um the Swiss government has got something called Apertus. Has anybody heard of Apertus?

**22:56** · Yes. I think it's quite interesting. They basically have an entirely ethically sourced data set, which I think is awesome. And then they train their their model on it, and they've trained not only a large-ish model, but lots of very small models. And I don't think people appreciate how powerful small language models can be when you get away from the hype.

**23:15** · Because with a small language model, you can run it locally, and a lot of the environmental issues go away. So, I do think it's possible to talk about ethically trained small language models running locally, and you don't have to sell your soul to the devil. So, I do think that there's some direction to talk about this. But, the key point I wanted to make is it's not about generation, it's about context. And by having this system embrace the desktop, use the file system, it actually got better.

**23:44** · So, to me, what I'd like to say is Claude Code was somewhere in the middle.

**23:48** · It wasn't really off the line, it was using the existing filing system, but I think it was a I'll give him the benefit of the doubt, let's put it a little bit off the line. To me, the question is can we expand this impact? Now that we know that if we embrace the actual desktop, and better things happen, how do we embrace it more?

**24:04** · So, what are the desktop building blocks? Well, we simply have obviously the big ones. We have Windows, we got files and icons, and the clipboard. Now, there's the mouse, and there's the keyboard, but those are more input systems.

**24:17** · And what I think is interesting is there these are the things that allow you to kind of capture and move and edit and store data. And that is the fun foundation of what I think a desktop UX does for users. It allows them to move data around. And it's the heart of what direct manipulation is, but I think that direct manipulation has a weakness. And it's that it has it's completely stateless.

**24:42** · It's very fast, it's very powerful, and if you are a very good user, you can move through it very very quickly, but if you come back the next day, you come back the next week, you're trying to figure out what happened, if you copy a few too many things to the for the to the clipboard, whoop, sorry, it's gone.

**24:56** · And so, there's a lot of issues with that. So, I actually kind of call this the curse of direct manipulation. It's powerful, but it doesn't really support you in the work that you're trying to do. And so, and I think we intuitively know that.

**25:11** · There are people that are rewriting when There are like what? 37 window managers for Linux?

**25:16** · Right? There's a There's probably more, right? Um there's also alternative shells, and there's alternative, you know, uh file managers. There's alternative clipboard managers. So, people are feeling this pain. These systems aren't quite working right, but what the solution seems to be is to solve them in their own silo. And I think for me, what I get excited about is to say, this is really about working memory. How do I manage my data in such a way that I can remember it across all of these things and actually use it.

**25:45** · So, I I got my perspective shift thinking about this more holistically outside of these things.

**25:52** · So, that's how what I What I'd like to do is to take that dot and move it out by saying, what would we do to working memory to improve the desktop UX?

**26:01** · And I want to make it sure it's really clear. I want to solve this for people first, and if the AI can use it, great. I don't care. That It'll That That comes later. Let's just focus on getting something for people.

**26:11** · Okay. So, the next point is to remember your past. There have been some great papers. This is a seminal paper from the '90s called Life Streams that talked about organizing your data, um you know, along a timeline. Uh I I recommend you get it. When They'd actually influenced WinFS, which is a really cool file system that was a relational database. It wasn't just the data, it's where you downloaded it from, who has worked on it, you know, that kind of thing. So, you could actually have a story about a history of what this file has been through.

**26:38** · That's what we mean by thinking outside the box, having a file system help you remember the journey this file has been on. And anybody know about Nepomuk?

**26:49** · Right?

**26:50** · And um another project that was, I think, very much ahead of its time. The problem with is that both of these projects basically crashed and burned. And it's really unfortunate because I think the ideas are really quite clever. And they now they've lived on in things like Spotlight or Baloo or things like that. But the the problem is there these are tiny tiny tiny variations of what the original vision was.

**27:11** · And my concern is that they you see these projects as proof that these ideas were wrong, which is no, not at all the case. I would say is that the the the hardware and the the systems at the time let the vision down. I think it's time to rethink a lot of these projects in light of new hardware. And maybe possibly make them a little bit simpler, but my point is these are not bad ideas. So, now what I would say is the questions that I would ask, and these are clearly my questions.

**27:41** · We can ask additional questions, but I would say, "Okay, let's remember that remember I told you how small the Macintosh was uh initially? People are a little freaked out when I tell them that the original Macintosh would fit within the screen of an iMac iPad Mini. That's how small the original Macintosh was.

**28:00** · What would happen if we designed only for large monitors? I mean really big like wide screen monitors, okay? It wouldn't work on laptops. I don't care.

**28:10** · I just want to try, right? I just want to see what it's like. What does it unlock if we try to design for large monitors, right? How can we tightly integrate, for example, the clipboard, files, and windows to a more holistic concept? What that look like? And how can we capture user intent over time?

**28:25** · So, I think these are the questions that I'd like to see explored. And like I said before, you focus on the questions, not the solutions. Now, I am going to show you prototypes right now and go into that, but I want to start with this quote from Donald Knuth, "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."

### Prototyping new desktop ideas

**28:41** · I am going to show you these prototypes, and I'm a little nervous about it because technical people love to find mistakes.

**28:50** · And oh my god, 10 minutes. Really?

**28:53** · Yeah.

**28:53** · Damn. I I got to speak fast.

**28:56** · Okay, so let's just go into that real quick. Um Let's see, go here. So, let me uh show this is effectively my simulation of a wide screen display. Um it's a little scaled down because of course this is not a wide screen. So, sorry that it's tiny.

**29:19** · But the idea here is that historically what people have done have done Exposé, which is how you would see things like this like this is what what Macintosh would do. But the problem is if I double the number of windows, Exposé breaks down very quickly. It turns into this Cartesian sort. And on top of all that, it's a it's a modal that I can't really interact with very easily. And those windows at a small size are still useful. So, what I'd like to do is to first of all realize that a wide screen is very difficult to work on the sides.

**29:48** · It's good for peripheral vision, but it's not good for working. So, by doing that, let's start by saying move the menu bar in because having the menu I have the icons in the corners is stupid.

**29:58** · Bring it in and then have that 50% um uh focus right there. And to reinforce that focus, what I'm going to do is add a background that basically says, "Okay, this is what the center is about and the sides are more the periphery." I'm not suggesting this is the desktop that you ship with. I'm just doing it so you guys can see where the morphing happens. And then what we'll do is I'll bring the the windows back. And the idea here is if I drag the window, the idea is that it can shrink down as I get to this spot and eventually I could dock it and pull it back. Now, that's not terribly interesting.

**30:29** · Um what I will say is I did play around with the idea of actually morphing it so that when I would drag it, it would actually slide.

**30:36** · Um um but it's not legible, right? If you can't read it. So, I I turned that off. I just did the regular one. But, the idea here though is that now that I I've taken something and I've moved it over here, it's still selectable. It's still a window. I can still do it. Now, not all windows can do this, but I now have this ability to have windows on the side that are a little bit more interactive and I can still use them.

**30:57** · Now, I'm not against virtual desktops. Virtual desktops are used by very organized and intelligent people. I know my audience. But, most consumers don't. And most consumers can't deal with virtual desktops. I'm trying to come up with something that's a little bit more organic and a little messy, actually.

**31:19** · And so, the idea here is that if I do have these things and I start to say play it, this is my uh music player I'm playing, also not only can I put it in this stash area, so I can still interact with it, I want to steal from effectively um the web, but which basically re- recombines things on small as I drag it over to the the size, it actually just reconfigures itself just to be a button.

**31:40** · So, I can play and pause. And so, now I've effectively turned a window into a widget. So, the idea here is to have a window manager, thank you, uh a window manager that is kind of part window manager, part exposé, part um uh uh just it is it's a it's a a bunch of things together and then the intention is, let me just reset everything here.

**32:03** · Um what I can then do is if I just take the window and shake it, they can go off to the side automatically, right? And so, and then and to to go there and say that I I have to rush a little bit. If I were to double the number of windows, okay, and shake it, um it scales fairly well and it scales even more. So, I think there's something to explore here to have this messy, organic kind of window manager that allows me to move things around and play with them. And I think Wayland can do all of this right now, right? This is not a fundamentally difficult thing to do. We just have to play around with it.

**32:34** · So, what I'd like to do is to build uh a real prototype of this and just see how it feels. And if it doesn't feel right, we can try figure something else out. So, I have to move quickly. I do have another version here, which is to say if we were to have a document, how could we store clipboard items and files a little bit better? So, the idea here is to steal a page from Obsidian.

**32:55** · If I were to select this text and say I don't want to work in this right now, I could drag it here. And if I were to then Now, it's not just a clipboard history, it's actually a clipboard file, but it's associated with this document. So, I could drag multiple things in.

**33:08** · I could also then say bring in a file over here and drag it in. I could go from a web browser and I could drag something in here and drag it in. And I'm I'm as a shortcut, I'm going to bring some more in. And the idea here is that this is now effectively a collection of stuff that I've gathered for this document. And if I close it and then come back tomorrow, it's all still there. It's all there.

**33:31** · It's all available to me. And now that I have my stuff and I can use it, now the local AI can come in and do things like, "Oh, look, you got a bunch of hotels.

**33:38** · Let me organize them for you, right?" Or if I click on the hotel, I can actually say map these and it would it would create a map that I can drag into my document. And the idea here is by the way, I can also split screen it so I can edit and not only can I view these things, I can even edit them. And so, we're now verging on effectively a baby version of virtual desktops, right? And move them back and forth. So, the idea here is to start to collect this data in a way that is still useful. Thank you.

**34:06** · Um so, let me then go into my next one cuz I'm going to I There's so much data that we could collect and that makes people nervous.

**34:15** · And so, I tried to come up with a way of doing telemetry that was more privacy-preserving. So, this is 50 websites that I browsed looking for an e-bike and most web browsers just give you a linear list. So, I decided and some browsers will give you a hierarchical view, but it's not very useful.

**34:31** · So, what I did was I just gathered uh what I thought was not content, right?

**34:35** · You know, how long have you scrolled?

**34:38** · You know, what how long were you there?

**34:39** · Did you Did you do a clipboard event? I didn't gather the clipboard. I said, "Did you do a copy? Did you do a paste?"

**34:45** · So, I grabbed effectively attention signals. And the idea was to say how and then mathematically I would I would do is I would take this and I would convert it into something like something I'm sorry.

**34:56** · I'd take this and I'd convert it into something like this. Take 50 nodes and convert it into seven. It's a very opinionated view that says, "Oh, here is your Google search and here's all the things that you did, but here's the three important ones and here's the pages that you landed on and I did this keep thing." Now, I'm not suggesting this is a UX for users. All this was trying to do is to gather really simple privacy-preserving data and not using AI, just using simple math, could I synthesize things down a little bit more?

**35:23** · And so, what I ended up saying was to say, "Well, what would happen if we actually had some kind of history of what I've been doing in the desktop?"

**35:31** · To say, "Oh, look, I was in the email and I went to go get a doc I went to um I opened up a document and I went and got an image and I worked in this document." And so, the idea here is to kind of tell a story of where you've spent your time.

**35:46** · And then once I have this kind of concept of history, I wanted to go back to say, "Well, let's turn history on here to say, 'Oh, well, now I've collected all this stuff. Where did this c- uh ca- clip come from?' Well, it came from this part of the document. Well, where did this budget come from? It came from this finder window. Where did this map come from? It came from here." So, we now are starting to tell a story that once we have this ability to collect all this data, we can now start to annotate it and and give it to the user and hopefully keep it all local, keep it all private and not gather that much information.

**36:17** · So, the goal here uh was to um give you guys this kind of rough idea and I have like 2 minutes left, right? So, I got to go back.

**36:29** · Uh So, I basically came up with the spatial, associative, and episodic memory prompt. I don't want you guys to think that I'm selling you on doing exactly these things. I'm just trying to explore the space to say, is this interesting? Is there something else we could be doing? So, I started with the spatial, a messy organic way of organizing your windows. The next was effectively associative. Take all your data and put it together so that it's captured, remembered, and survives being you know, restarted. So, I have more of it together.

**36:59** · And finally it was this episodic memory to say, can we gather telemetry in a good way and then organize it for the user so that it actually can be shown to them in an interesting helpful way. So, that's effectively what I was trying to get us excited about. And these are the prototypes that I want us to build. And the idea here is I've been pitching this idea to all these distros, trying to get somebody to get excited about building these things out as an experiment on the side that's totally optional.

### Call to action for open source

**37:27** · And I'll blow through this. In can switch has got a really lovely model. I worked with them on this project called Upwelling. The idea is to effectively build up small team of people, build something really quickly, and then build a prototype and open source it. And this is like the superpower of open source. We can actually do this research in the open.

**37:46** · So, all I'm In closing, the main thing I want for you guys is to understand this problem, to realize what an issue it is, and how we should be looking for solutions. My perspective is I think working memory is a good example of where we should go.

**38:00** · I think there's other perspectives and I want to talk to people about it. And the three uh memories is what I kind of came up with as an approach. And I'd like to explore a little bit more. So, the goal with this talk is to say, let's start to take this apart. And I really hope that my prototypes cause you guys to come to me and say, well, you forgot about this.

**38:19** · And And talk about that. But I'm excited that KDE cares enough about the user experience that we could actually try to build something like that. So, I just want us to try because no one else is going to try and I think someone's got to start. That's what I'm going to do. So, thank you very much.

**38:35** · \[applause\] \[applause\] You're welcome.

**38:53** · \[applause\] I think we have time for one question.

**39:01** · I went too long, I'm sorry.

**39:05** · Who wants to be the first and the last?

**39:08** · And if not, grab me afterwards. I really want to talk to people. So, just if you you don't have time now, don't be shy later.

**39:17** · Um you've mentioned something about all this memory stuff and my question is how is this model going to protect against the privacy concerns that Microsoft faced with Windows Recall?

**39:33** · As in how are we going to make sure that this history remains only accessible by the user and cannot be hacked in like it could happen with the Windows Recall.

**39:42** · The biggest argument against this is that you've just created the world's greatest honeypot and so everyone's going to go after it, which is why the telemetry idea was trying to gather not interesting information, right? If you're gathering focus information and not text, I think that significantly reduces the heat. I do not want to underplay the issue. I think this issue needs more discussion.

**40:03** · Um what I'd like to do though is I'd like to build a prototype and see if it's a good idea first, right? And if it's good, then let's talk about ways to then further encrypt it because even the safer telemetry is still valuable information, right?

**40:17** · So, I completely agree with you, but I I mean people keep their bank details on their computer today. Right? And people seem to be okay with that. So, I do feel like this is not much a step above what you already are storing. We just have to be very, very careful. Windows Recall's biggest mistake was how stupidly they protected that data.

**40:41** · Right? And I think we can do a whole lot better than that. So, I want to acknowledge your point, but I'd like to think it's a solvable problem.

**40:47** · I see. Thank you.

**40:48** · You're welcome.
